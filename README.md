# Deck of Cards (doc)

Priority of focus was on class design and testing for this coding assignment. I have included some notes via Python comments in parts of the code to explain some of my thoughts I had along the way.

Something I decided **not** to allocate time to were docstrings to properly document the class constructors, methods, and their arguments. This seemed less important in terms of judging my ability but by no means do I think it's not important for a real application. I also did not focus on making multiple namespaces (directories) to hold the classes since it seemed like overkill.
